# Zack's Coding Quiz

## Purpose
This is a learning project assigned to demonstrate the knowledge I've acquired on JavaScript during CWRU's coding bootcamp.  The project was coded from scratch using HTML CSS and JavaScript.  The goal was to build a functioning quiz that advanced as you answered questions. It required a timer that started after clicking the START button. It also require the time would be penalized for a wrong answer.  Finally there was a score requirement, that kept track of score during the quiz and was stored locally using the DOM API.
